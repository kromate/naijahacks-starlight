# Problem
high cost of educational resources like books, tutorials, e.t.c
# Proposed Solution
A very Simple Web Service that will bring people together to share their used Books and donate different educational resources such as books or materials.   
This idea was gotten from our childhood experience, where the elder ones pass on their books to the younger ones but usually, when the last born is done using the books, they are usually destroyed one way or other. Our service provides a solution in which every one benefit. 
# Proposed Stack
- Frontend ( HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

- less destruction of book.
